## Problem statement

### Low-Level Design of a LinkedIn-like Professional Networking Platform
Design a simplified version of a professional networking platform similar to LinkedIn, focusing on key functionalities such as user profiles, connections, and posts. Prioritize core features and consider both the data model and the interactions between different components of the system. If time permits in the end, we can do feed generation as a follow-up.
